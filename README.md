# How to Play
Left click on the yellow tiles to flip them
<br>
If there is no fire nearby, white flowers will be planted
<br>
If there are fires nearby, the tiles will turn red and tell you how many fires are adjacent to that tile
<br>
Right click to place seeds on top of tiles o think may have a fire
<br>
You win by either turning all fire-free tiles or placing seeds on all bomb tiles
<br>
(!!!Careful! You only have 10 seeds for the 20 fires!!!)
